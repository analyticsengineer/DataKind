#### Project Purpose: Identifying potential eligibility-enrollment gap localities

#### Project sub tasks
- Identify high potential eligibility locations by identifying communities with significant (e.g. top 5,10,25% - you will need to make a determination) populations at 150% or more of the federal poverty line. Describe those localities in terms of their location and demography

- Compare the potential eligibility to the current reported uptake of SNAP benefits and present the potential gap. Describe the localities with the largest potential gaps in terms of location and demography (visualizations, statistics, etc.)
